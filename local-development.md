# Working with Local Files in Remote Agent

The Remote Agent is specifically designed to:
1. Access files directly on your laptop
2. Work with your local repository at C:\msys64\home\teodor\vkth_micropython
3. Execute commands in your local MSYS2 environment
4. Compile code using your local toolchain

No external repository access is needed - everything happens on your machine.
